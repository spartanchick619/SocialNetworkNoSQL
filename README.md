# SocialNetworkNoSQL

## Description
SocialNetworkNoSQL is an API for a social network web application where users share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. This was built using MongoDB, Mongoose, JavaScript and Express. The challenge was there was a technical issue with communication between GitHub and insomnia so there is no tutorial video unfortunately. 

## Installation
Invoking npm i 

## Usage
In the reposotory: open the documentation and run 'npm i'. Once the server is running, use an application like insomnia to test the API.

## Tutorial Video
